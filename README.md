## Description
Rust-based **Man in the Middle proxy**, an early-stage project aimed at providing visibility into network traffic. Currently, it displays both HTTP and HTTPS requests and responses, but our future goal is to allow for manipulation of the traffic for more advanced use cases.

## Getting Started

1. Generate a Certificate:
  - go to `mitmproxy/` directory
  - start generation with following terminal command: `openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout mitmproxy.key -out mitmproxy.cer -sha256 -days 700000 -nodes`
  - You can just hit `Enter` to accept default options but keep in mind to add at least a `common name`
